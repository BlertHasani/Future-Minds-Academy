                Curtis James Jackson III (born July 6, 1975), known professionally as 50 Cent, is an American rapper,
                actor,
                television producer, and businessman. Born in South Jamaica, a neighborhood of Queens, Jackson began
                pursuing a
                musical career in 1996. In early 2000, he recorded his "debut" album Power of the Dollar for Columbia
                Records,
                however he was struck by nine bullets during a shooting in May of that year, causing its release to be
                cancelled
                and Jackson to be dropped from the label. In 2002, Jackson released the mixtape Guess Who's Back?, and
                was
                thereafter discovered by Eminem and signed to his label Shady Records, an imprint of Dr. Dre's Aftermath
                Entertainment and Interscope Records.
